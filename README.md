# 🌍 Geospatial AI Risk Engine: 41-Year Climatic Time-Series Forecasting
**Architecting Agricultural Resilience through Deep Learning and SPI-based Feature Engineering**

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project transforms 41 years of granular IMD climatic data into a high-fidelity **Early Warning System (EWS)** for drought and rainfall risk. By moving beyond traditional statistics, it utilizes **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to predict multi-scale temporal indices (SPI-3 to SPI-18), providing a blueprint for risk management in semi-arid regions.

### 🎯 Key Engineering Highlights
* **Big Data Pipeline:** Engineered features from **15,000+ daily observations** (1980–2021).
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Automated calculation of the **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** across multiple time scales.
* **Architecture:** Hybrid modeling approach combining **Deep Learning (LSTMs)** with **Ensemble Methods (XGBoost/Random Forest)** for baseline comparison.
* **Production Ready:** Fully containerized environment for seamless deployment on AWS/Azure.

## 🛠️ System Architecture


The pipeline is modularized into three core services:
1. **Ingestion Engine:** Automated cleaning and normalization of IMD raw datasets.
2. **Analysis Core:** SPI computation and statistical stationarity testing (ADF/KPSS).
3. **Forecasting Service:** LSTM model training, hyperparameter tuning, and inference.
